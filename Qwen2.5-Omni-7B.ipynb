Another reason could be that dreams might be related to your emotions. If you're stressed or happy, your dreams could be reflecting that. And some scientists think that dreams could also be a way for your brain to practice things, like if you dream about running, it could be a way to practice your running skills. But it's still not completely clear. So, what do you think about dreams? Do you have any interesting dreams to share?\n",

Then, when it sees a new picture, it can figure out if it's a cat or a dog based on what it learned before. It doesn't need to be told exactly what to do, it just figures it out from the data.
